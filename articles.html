                    <h3>10 Ways to Make the Most of This Summer</h3>
                    <h4>Author: Sardam Akram</h4>
                    <h5>June 27, 2023</h5>
                    <p>Summer break is truly a gift, even if you have nothing planned! It is a long well-deserved time to reflect on yourself, 
                        relax, learn, and follow your hobbies. 
                        Here are ten ideas of how you can make the most out of your summer break.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            1. Travel: Explore new places, both locally and internationally. Traveling can broaden your horizons, 
                            expose you to different cultures, and provide valuable experiences. 
                            It could be a solo adventure, a group trip with friends, or even volunteering abroad.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            2. Internships or part-time jobs: Gain practical experience in your field of study by pursuing internships 
                            or part-time jobs related to your career interests.
                             This can help you build your resume and make valuable connections in the industry.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>
                            3. Research or independent study: If you’re passionate about a particular topic, consider engaging in research or an independent study project. 
                            This can deepen your knowledge and skills in your area of interest.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            4. Online courses or certifications: Utilize the break to learn something new or enhance your existing skills. There are numerous online platforms 
                            that offer courses and certifications in various subjects, including Coursera and LinkedIn Learning.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>
                            5. Volunteer work: Dedicate your time to a cause you care about by volunteering for a nonprofit organization or community project. 
                            This can be a rewarding way to give back to society while also developing your leadership and teamwork skills.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            6. Read books: Catch up on your reading list, whether it’s related to your studies or for personal enjoyment. 
                            Reading can expand your knowledge, improve your critical thinking, and provide relaxation.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            7. Health and wellness: Take care of your physical and mental well-being. Engage in regular exercise,
                             try out new sports or activities, practice mindfulness or meditation, and prioritize self-care.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            8. Personal projects: Pursue personal projects that you may not have had time for during the academic year.
                             This could include writing a blog, starting a YouTube channel, learning a musical instrument, or developing a hobby.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            9. Networking and professional development: Attend industry conferences, seminars, or workshops 
                            to network with professionals in your field. This can provide valuable insights, career guidance, and potential job opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            10. Spend time with family and friends: Summer break is an excellent time to reconnect with loved ones. Plan gatherings, outings, and quality time with 
                            family and friends to create lasting memories. Also, make sure to recharge and relax this summer. After an action-packed year of learning, 
                            university students need time to de-stress,
                             free of study and work duties. 
                            Taking time to relax during summer break is important and crucial to avoid burnout. You will be much more motivated when the fall semester starts, too!

                        </p>

                    <h3>Indian Food Point: A Spicy Culinary Adventure</h3>
                    <h4>Author: Zuhdiya Abdullah</h4>
                    <h5>Date: Nov 7, 2024</h5>
                    <p>Nestled near Salim Street in Slemani, Indian Food Point is a culinary oasis, my go-to place for an authentic Indian dining experience. 
                        It’s not just about the food; it’s the Indian vibe that envelops you as you step in. </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Upon entering Indian Food Point, the ambiance was serene, a perfect setting for our culinary exploration. The restaurant, although empty at that hour, 
                            exuded an inviting charm. The service, though a bit slow, 
                            was compensated by the intricacies of the dishes served. Plates, seemingly made of rustic mud, were artfully placed in front of us, 
                            evoking the feeling of dining on a village table in India. 
                            The attention to detail, from the presentation to the choice of plates, added an extra layer of authenticity to our experience.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>
                            Our gastronomic journey kicked off with Aloo Prantha and Samosas. The Aloo Prantha, a delightful blend of spiced potato stuffed in bread, 
                            was a true indulgence. 
                            Accompanied by a trio of sauces that balanced spice, sweetness, and coolness perfectly, 
                            it set the stage for what was to come.
                             The samosas, crispy pockets of joy, delighted our taste buds. 
                            The authenticity of these appetizers transported me straight to the streets of India.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Delving into the main courses, we explored an array of dishes like their Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Masala, 
                            and Mutton Kadai. Mutton, in this context, refers to meat from sheep, goats, and rams. 
                        Butter Chicken is a yogurt-based dish, with the main ingredients being chicken, yogurt, butter, heavy cream, and, of course, a blend of Indian spices 
                        such as turmeric and garam masala. 
                        While the Chicken Tikka Masala was less thick, and the tomatoes and onions were chunkier, 
                        adding more texture to the sauce. The Chicken Biryani was spicier than the Biryani we have here in Kurdistan. The Mutton Masala had the same texture as the
                         Chicken Masala, with the only difference being the use of “Mutton” instead of chicken. 
                        The Mutton Kadai’s main ingredients were mutton, ginger, turmeric, garlic, onion, and garam masala, which together created a mild sauce, holding the mutton.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                        Each dish promised a unique adventure in taste. The spice levels, though, were a rollercoaster. The Mutton Kadai, while flavorful, 
                        was drowned in an overshadowing sauce, rendering it almost inedible. 
                        On further analysis, I realized the overpowering spice was due to an excess of salt, an unexpected glitch in an otherwise promising dish.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                        I sampled various other dishes too, and each had its distinct appeal. However, the spice levels occasionally overshadowed the subtleties of the flavors. 
                        The diverse range of tastes catered to my adventurous palate, but they also posed a challenge for my friends. 
                        Three of them were experiencing Indian cuisine for the first time. One of my friends couldn’t finish the Biryani, finding it too spicy. Another
                         found the Mango Lassi a bit peculiar, 
                        while the Chicken Masala proved spicier than any dish she usually indulges in. Yet, amidst these varied reactions, 
                        one friend embraced the adventure wholeheartedly, 
                        enjoying the unique flavors and spices.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ways to Help Animals During The Summer! </h3>
                        <h4>Author: Sidra</h4>
                        <h5>Date: June 27, 2023</h5>
                        <p>Summer is around the corner and the weather is getting unbearably hot. Grabbing a delicious ice-cream cone and hanging out in a breezy place 
                            feels just perfect. 
                            We, humans, are capable of expressing our need to cool down from the heat by having cold drinks or ice cream, heading out somewhere breezy 
                            to forget about the heat, 
                            or simply by complaining that it is hot. However, this is not the same case for the other creatures.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                            We encounter lots of stray animals looking for food and water, and because summer is near, hydration, as well as food, are as vital as ever 
                            for all living creatures. 
                            Therefore, this is where our role takes place in helping animals. In fact; you can help the animals during the summer by following these four easy steps:
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p>
                                1) Put your leftovers out for them to eat.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                If you cannot finish your food, the best next step is not throwing it away. Put our leftovers non-sharp bowls or trays near where you live to save 
                                a couple of stray 
                                animals from starving. This way you will also get to watch them from your window and smile with contentment! 
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                2) Save those plastic buckets. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Yes, the plastic buckets! Don’t throw away the buckets after finishing up your yogurt or cheese! These plastic bottles might not be very big, 
                                but they are perfect water containers.
                                 Fill the buckets with water (tap water will do) and place them somewhere outside your living space. 
                                P.S: Any plastic bottle or container that you usually throw away might work just fine as a bowl of water for the animals. 
                                Just make sure they are not sharp. 
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                3) While parking your car in the shade, also leave room for the stray animals.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Trees (especially big ones) provide us with a nice shade to protect us from the direct sunlight. Animals also find this relatable. 
                                Everyone likes to leave their cars in the shade, 
                                however, be reminded of the animals, and leave some space for them as well!
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                4) Be gentle, and don’t be scared! 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                If you are not the biggest fan of cats, dogs, or even birds, you can help by not getting too startled when you see them; 
                                because this will startle them as well! So let’s help keep our four-legged friends, 
                                as well as our morning singing friends feel safe when they’re around!
                                Since these are all easy things to do, why not make our day a little brighter by helping those beautiful creatures? 
                                When animals grow up feeling secure in the presence of humans, they develop a natural affinity as they mature, regardless 
                                of whether they were raised indoors or not. This shows their trust in us when we lend a hand, 
                                and it brings a delightful touch to our day whenever such moments arise!
                            </p>
                            
                            
                            
                    </div>

                                        which recognizes students for their academic excellence and service learning, was attended by faculty members, staff, and students. 
                                    </p>
                                    <br>

                        <p>
                        The program has two main categories of awards: Academic Excellence Awards as well as Service Learning Program Awards.
                        The President’s Award is given to students who have earned a GPA of 3.75-4.0, while the Dean’s Award is given to students with a GPA of 3.5-3.74.
                        The Service Learning Program 
                        Award also recognizes students who have contributed a significant amount of voluntary hours to the community. 
                        The Service Learning Program Awards are divided into five categories: Regular, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. 
                        The Regular Award is given to students who have contributed 10-25 voluntary hours, while the Diamond Award is given to students who have contributed more than 100 hours.

                            In his speech, Dr. Bruce, AUIS President, stated that the university is proud of its students. 
                            Dr. Barin, Dean of Students, also gave a speech, reminding students that the memories they make during their time at AUIS are as important as the certificates they receive.
                             He also added that not being awarded on this day should not be a cause for concern. He pointed out that over time, 
                            the certificate itself may even be lost, but the experiences and memories gathered during one’s time here will always be remembered. 
                        </p>

                            Rania, an AUIS MLS student, received two awards, the President’s Award for her academic excellence and the Regular Award for donating voluntary hours.
                             When asked how she balances her academic life with extracurricular activities, she said, “Time management is all I need. 
                             I make sure to grab any opportunity to do something useful.” For example, she mentioned, instead of just waiting for an appointment, 
                             she uses that waiting time to study or read something useful.
                             Avesta, a law major, received a 4.0 GPA. When asked what motivates her, she said, “I make sure that my time away from my family is used for its utmost advantage,
                              and not a second of it goes to waste.”
                        </p>

                        <h3>Benefits of Extracurricular Activities: How They Can Make You a Better Student and Person</h3>

                        When we start college, we generally believe that classes and assignments will define our life there. Therefore, we give all our attention to studying and forget 
                        that there are other important things. </p>

                        <br>

                    <p>
                    Studying too much can cause burnout when our brain concentrates on deadlines and academic responsibilities in a way that it leaves no space for our hobbies and interests.
                    This can have a negative impact on our brain. 
                    Spending most of your time on your books does not guarantee excellent academic performance. Your brain needs to take rests and be free from the stress that comes along with studying. 
                    It is important to remember that college is more than just a place for academic achievement; it’s also a space to develop one’s character and leadership potential.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Extracurricular activities are a pathway to boost your academic performance and develop a strong personality. During my time as a college student,
                        I worked as a Study Center Monitor voluntarily. My responsibilities included keeping the Study Center as quiet as possible, 
                        while doing this, I had to calmly and firmly communicate with the students who were using the area for studying. This experience enhanced my communication skills. Years later, 
                        I am still using those skill. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Critical thinking, time management, and a strong memory are all skills that can enhance your grades. Recreational activities, such as swimming, hiking, walking, cycling, etc, can all 
                        improve your metabolism, which energizes your body and activates your brain. 
                        Once we engage in these activities, we will have more energy to perform better in classes and also feel better. This makes us concentrate more on details and identify problems faster. 
                        Students who participate in sports activities and tournaments tend to do better in class. By doing something that you are interested in, you learn to prioritize your tasks. 
                        It helps you find a balance between your education and interests and to manage your time efficiently. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Engaging your brain in the process of performing an activity positively impacts your memory as well. Continuing with one or more activities even after graduation 
                        strengthens your memory as you get older. Now remember, 
                        we must not lose focus on our classes. Both activities and studies need to go hand in hand. We need to keep a healthy balance, and try to perform well
                         in classes while remembering to practice our hobbies, and prioritize our health. 
                    </p>
