                        <p>
                        1- Thelma & Louise (1991) Crime/Adventure
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s to living the life you deserve. This movie is for all the ladies out there who are sick and tired of their everyday routine – either stuck in a job they hate 
                        or a marriage they no longer stand – and they just want to drop everything and leave for a while. Louise (Susan Sarandon) encourages Thelma (Geena Davis) to go on an innocent fishing trip, which later
                         turns into a wild pass through hell.
                        The sudden behavior and attitude shift in Thelma’s character boosts mood. She shifts from a follow-by-the-rules housewife to a wild one at heart. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                        2- Dumb & Dumber (1994) Comedy/Screwball comedy
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s to lots of laughs. Unlike Thelma and Louise, Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are forced into a situation in which they have to take the road to only escape one mess and jump into another.
                        Lloyd and Harry’s characters are a perfect match to boost one’s mood – their characters are fun and bold. That said, their reckless acts can trigger one to loosen up and just go out there and roll 
                        with every obstacle coming on the way regardless 
                        of the consequences for light will eventually find its way back to you if you are as lucky as Lloyd and Harry. 
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                        3- RV (2006) Family/Comedy
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s to a hysterical dysfunctional family on the road. If you have not seen it, RV can be your next best family vacation movie. When a family of four hit the road in a troublesome RV for what they assume is a vacation to reunite 
                        the dysfunctional family, almost everything starts breaking apart. 
                        The different characters’ personalities in this family are what is making this movie funny. 
                        The way they attempt to handle all the obstacles thrown onto their way is hilarious.
                        Their hilarious failed attempts as a family to get back on their feet and carry on can boost your mood by showing you how even the worst situations in life can bring people closer to each other.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        4- Into the Wild (2007) Adventure/Drama 
                        <br><br>
                    Here’s to a new beginning. Unlike everything introduced so far, this movie is not as full of action as one might hope. Though this movie has a tragic ending, Christopher McCandless’s 
                    (Emile Hirsch) journey through the wilderness can be inspiring. It shows you how you can make use of your free will.
                    The freedom and free will Christopher experiences can genuinely make you happy by simply showing you that you can be whatever you want to be and be wherever you want. Christopher’s character demonstrates how much someone can change.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        5- Identity Thief (2013) Comedy
                        <br><br>
                    Here’s to making a friend out of a thief. Watch Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) hitting the road to catch the person who has stolen his identity. As soon as Sandy Patterson encounters none other than his identity thief
                    , Dawn (Melissa McCarthy), his whole life turns upside down when he finds out that his identity thief is being chased by people who want her dead.
                    Sandy’s character changes from a working husband to a man who is willing to go all the way to get his identity back. In the process of gaining back his identity, Sandy and Dawn stumble upon many wild adventures, 
                    which will only bring them closer together. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        6- We’re the Millers (2013) Comedy/Crime
                        <br><br>
                    Here’s to the family created from scratch. Four strangers brought together with one purpose in mind. They start hitting the road to Mexico and stumble upon a strange family, a mafia group, and so on. Watch to see how they
                     hysterically rat each other out and start to grow on each other as they drive through hell together.
                    This movie shows how much someone can grow on you only if you give yourself the chance to get to know them.

                    <h3>Hiking Through a Nightmare</h3>
                    <h4>Author: Asma Jutyar</h4>
                    <h5>Date: Feb 4, 2023</h5>
                    <p>
                        It is a Thursday evening. You are bored. Scrolling through your Instagram feed, you come across hiking trip advertisement to Goma Dawre, in Qaradagh.
                         You have never heard of that name, nor are you sure what the trip will be like. But the place looks nice in the pictures. You don’t want to be bored on Friday as well, 
                         so you sign up! What can go wrong? Any day out is certainly better than a day in, or so you thought. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        You wake up early Friday morning, put on makeup, and wear your most colorful outfit. Gotta look good in those pictures! You buy some croissants,
                         a cup of noodles, one large Pringles chips, and that is it, that is your food for the hike. You have never been great at packing anyways.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The bus passes through Qaradagh. You think to yourself “Why was I not just born here, in the wild?” Then the bus stops, and the hike starts. Do you have 
                        any idea of what this hike is going to be like? No! The minute you start walking, you regret it.
                         Not that it is too difficult just yet, but because you are just too scared of everything. But you remind yourself, “Any day out is certainly better than a day in!” 
                         And so you continue walking with no idea how much more you still need to walk. 
                         And you walk and you walk. You start feeling tired. You brought only two bottles of water. You did not know how lengthy the trail was. So whenever the thirst gets to you,
                          you drink only the slightest bit of water. 
                         Gotta save that water up! And then you walk and you walk some more. 
                         You remember the advertisement you saw.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The destination was a lake. But you have been hiking for nearly two hours now, and no drop of water is anywhere to be found. 
                        So you ask the guide “Are we there yet?” “No, but in 20 minutes, oh my god, we are gonna arrive at a place,
                        you will forget all your exhaustion.” Whatever, you continue hiking, 20 minutes pass, 30 minutes pass, you now feel like you are lost. What happened? You were trying your best not to fall 
                        behind, and now, now this is the fastest you can go,
                        and you are behind with no sight of the guide whatsoever. You are not walking slowly because you are too tired! No, you are young, and energetic, and nothing can beat you. No, nothing can 
                        beat you except for slippery, rocky surfaces
                         that are ahead of you when you are trying to go down a valley. 
                        This is not the most terrible part of it all. The most terrible part of it all is that it is now nearly 3:00 pm, and you have been going down hills for nearly three hours. You are sure that you cannot
                         go back up the same way you
                         came down. It will be dark, there will be wild animals, and it is just 
                        impossible to climb up where you have come down from. So you ask the guide, “ How are we going to go back?” and he says “ Do not worry at all. We will go back in a different direction,
                         it will only take us 20 minutes.” And then you
                         get more terrified because you know his 20 minutes are two hours long. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        You finally arrive there! Yay! No, not yay! You have to cross the lake to go to the other side. There are plastic pipelines that you are expected to go on top.
                         And then you tightly grab onto the edge of one rock to go by the lake. That was easy! You think. Good job, me!! But that was only the topping on the cake. You are now in a very rocky area.
                          You are now on top of rocks that are clearly not made for humans to be standing at. To make things worse, you look down ad see the lake you saw in the advertisement, and you remember you don’t even know how to swim.
                           “What happens if I fall?” you ask. “ We suggest you don’t try that out,” they answer. And now you need to go down stairs that are on top of some rocks. The stair is not at all attached to anything. 
                           Not that you are not scared of them enough anyways.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So you want to cry, but you know the only thing you can do right now is to go on that stair and pray you don’t fall. So you do that. You have been hiking for three hours or more.
                         And you have barely finished one bottle of water. But you do not feel thirsty. You have not eaten anything in the morning, but you do not feel hungry. You do not feel anything at all, but fear. So you continue.
                          The nightmare is yet to have ended. You need to go to the other side of the lake. And there is one thing for you to go over, to get there. You do not quite know what the name of this thing is, which is two plates of steel, 
                          and midway filled with concrete, but you know that when you crawl over it, you should not look down. So you do that. And now, there are steps you have to go over. The steps are made of steel, 
                          and when you go over them, they shake under your feet.
                           But you complete that too, without falling, or else you may not have been writing this now.

                        <h3>Introduction to Disability Studies: A Class that Changed My Perspective</h3>
                        <h4>Author: Shanyan Nozad</h4>
                        <h5>Date: Feb 4, 2023</h5>
                        <p>
                        Have you ever thought of taking a course that changes your life perspective on a certain topic to positive?  

                        The topic of disability has never been touched upon and has always been ignored by the society,
                        government, and education here in the Kurdistan Region and Iraq, which has led disabled people to difficulties, trying to fit in the society and access certain things.  
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        But there is hope. My experience— and I’m sure, other students’ too with the course,
                         Introduction to Disability Studies, — proves the quality of our learning we have acquired beyond just the classroom. 
                         For the first time in Iraq and the Kurdistan Region, Introduction to Disability Studies, 
                         a course at AUIS has been offered since fall 2021 to provide students insights about the notion of disability from different viewpoints. The instructor of the course, Professor Lynn Rose, 
                         frequently brings guest speakers to talk about their life stories and experiences as a disabled person. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        What is new and different about the course lies within the nature of the course: it holds onto a totally different view on the issue of disability and understanding our behavior towards people with disabilities. 

                    My perspective on the topic of disability has completely changed from day one throughout the course. For instance, prior to taking the course,
                    I did not know that there is actually a line between kindness and pity with disabilities: similar to the rest of the society, I would treat a disabled person with extra kindness 
                    and compassion out of a good intention, not knowing that I was mistaken. Sometimes, we try to offer them help without first asking, assuming that they need help even though they might not. We might also judge someone’s
                     disability as a logical cause for the difficulties they may face or ask what their disability is out of curiosity, not realizing how much it irritates them. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, these common misperceptions tied to people with disabilities underline victimization and heroism. Society sees them as needed members who should always be pitied upon or sympathized due to their 
                        disabilities.
                         And seeing a disabled person being able to achieve something would seem very heroic and inspirational for a non-disabled person, which also adds up to the misconception of understanding disability. 
                         They are portrayed to motivate non-disabled people by their external disabilities, which pushes them to try to prove to others what they can do. 

                        The social and medical models of disability which convey insights in regard to attitudes, prejudices, 
                        and notions towards disability by the society were the core focuses of the course to comprehensively understand how the society perceives people with disabilities. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        The social model of disability states that people are disabled by the barriers created by society. It aims to eliminate the barriers in the society and create an equal and accessible environment for disabled persons.
                         However, the medical model insists that people with disabilities are disabled by their impairments and illnesses.

                        Raz, a recent graduate from the English department at AUIS, emphasized the importance of tailoring your resume to the job you’re applying for.
                         Keeping your resume simple and concise, and highlighting experiences related to the field or job can increase your chances of getting call backs.

                        Ali Khiro, a senior student majoring in MLS at AUIS, highlighted the challenges students face in a competitive job market with limited work experience.
                         He suggested using online job portals, building networks, gaining relevant experience through internships or volunteer work, and attending job fairs and conferences to overcome these obstacles.

                        Sara Nawzad, a graduate from Charmo University, stressed the importance of being confident but normal during interviews. Creating a friendly and
                         comfortable environment with the interviewer can help overcome interview nerves.

                        To make your job search more effective, here are some dos and don’ts:
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do: Define your unique skills: Knowing your skills and strengths before starting your job search is crucial. 
                            It helps you identify what jobs to look for and where to apply and develop your skills further.</li>
                        <li>Don’t: Seek jobs outside your skill area: It’s important to be realistic and not apply to positions that are far outside your skills.
                             This can decrease your chances of getting hired and cause you to miss other opportunities that may be a better fit for your skills.</li>
                        <li>Do: Design a simple resume: Your resume and cover letter should be clear, well-structured, and highlight your experiences and qualifications.
                             Keep them simple and easy to read.</li>
                        <li>Don’t: Post just anything on social media: it’s important to steer clear of engaging in negative behavior on social media, such as cyberbullying or online arguments.
                             These actions could reflect poorly on your character and ultimately harm your chances of landing a job.</li>
                        <li>Do: Network with others: Building a strong network of connections can open up more opportunities. Start networking early, 
                            even before graduating from college, to increase your chances of finding post-graduation opportunities.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <h3>Russia-Ukraine: Double standards at wartime</h3>
                        <h4>Author: Saya Abdulrahman</h4>
                        <h5>Date: Apr 10, 2022</h5>
                    <p>
                        The recent double standard in Ukraine media coverage confirms that unfortunately, racism and discrimination are still alive in the 21st century.
                    With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the situation understandably became the center of the news around the world. However, the shocking point arising 
                    here was the racist statements by some media journalists.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        D’Agata of US network CBS News said that, “This isn’t a place — with all due respect, you know — like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades.
                         This is a relatively civilized, relatively European — I have to choose those words carefully too – a city where you wouldn’t expect that or hope it is going to happen.”
                        After realizing that his remarks angered the Middle Easternaudience, D’Agata apologized for his “poor choice of words” a day later.
                         The shock of distinctions between Ukraine and other Middle Eastern countries like Iraq or Afghanistan stunned the world. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Like Ukraine, Syria was devastated and invaded by Russia. 
                        Syria became a laboratory for testing Russia’s weapons. Along with that, many Middle Eastern countries like Iraq went through years of conflict and war where many civilians, 
                        includingwomen and children, were killed, and yet the disaster was not given enough attention.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        After unleashing Operation Desert Storm by the United States, a memorandum of understanding was finally reached in 1996, resulting in the Oil For Food Program 
                        (OFFP) which allowed Iraq to resume oil exports in controlled quantities. 
                        However, the funds were held in escrow and the majority of Iraq’s purchases had to be individually approved by the “Iraq Sanctions Committee,” composed of the fifteen members of the UNSC.
                         On May 12, 1996, Madeleine Albright (then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations)
                         appeared on 60 Minutes (An American T.V. show program) in which Lesley Stahl, the host of the show, asked her,”We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that’s more children
                          than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?” Albright replied, 
                         “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.” When it comes to analyzing these kinds of statements 
                         it can clearly be observed that there is still discrimination by the global north against the Middle East. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Looking at Albright’s answer and the recent journalist’s comments on Ukraine, it seems like one’s life’s worth depends on where one is located. It is worthless 
                        if one is from the Middle East and worth saving if one is from the global north. Statements like “they look like us”,
                         reveal that discrimination and racism still structure the way many Europeans think of Middle Eastern people’s life. This is why Ukraine’s refugees must be saved and cared for,
                          unlike Middle Eastern people. For example, the Kurds, who have lived in decades of war, and suffered genocide and 
                         systemic oppression that cost them millions of lives including children and the elderly, yet, their lives are being played with as if they are a chess pawns. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Many think that countries in the Middle East, like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan are used to living in conflicts. Kelly Cobiella from NBC News said that, “these are not refugees from Syria,
                         these are refugees from Ukraine. They are Christians. They are white.” 
                        It is unfortunate to say how these statements tell the severity of the degree of distinction made between Middle Eastern and European people. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        In addition to the dichotomy of ‘civilized’ and ‘uncivilized’, the class background was also mentioned. Al Jazeera Englishanchor Peter Dobbie said that “the way they’re dressed, 
                        these are prosperous middle-class people,
                         these are not obviouslytrying to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war.” David Sakvarelizde, former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, 
                         said that “It is really emotional for me because 
                         European people with blue eyes and blonde hair are being killed.” Let us recall that this statement erases Black people’s plight during this crisis.

                        <h3>AUIS Students Express Their Dissatisfaction With the Provided Courses for the Spring 2022 Semester</h3>
                        <h4>Author: Ghazala Jango</h4>
                        <h5>Date: Dec 9, 2021</h5>
                    <p>
                        The American University of Iraq, Sulaimani, students express their dissatisfaction for the coming spring schedule and courses due to lack of required courses in the schedule and specialized instructors.
                     Students are now more concerned than ever as the university is not offering them all the classes they are required to take. This leads to students not being able to graduate on time,
                     especially since they also lack specialized instructors in their specialized department of study. This is a dead-end and an obstacle for so many students who want to graduate on time and take more professional 
                     classes that will help them in their future careers.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        A student majoring in International Studies (IS) addresses her concern in this regard and states, “there are some classes students are required to take to graduate,
                         but they are not offered, so those students have to wait an entire semester for the courses to be offered.”
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        “Also, there were some interesting classes for core options, which I personally want to take, such as psychology and art classes, but they are no longer being offered. So, 
                        the issue is that we lack both courses and specialized instructors, and the university never clarifies why they do not bring in new instructors for departments like English, Law, and IS.” She added.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        This is a serious issue that so many students specifically IS, Medical Lab, English, and Law students
                         are at the moment. Their main concern is the delay of their graduation, as well as the lack of instructors who are specialized in the topics they’re teaching.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        I personally will be graduating next semester from journalism, but I have not had a single specialized journalism instructor to teach me except for one class. This concerns me as 
                        I’m worriedI will not have the adequate knowledge to dive into my profession as a journalist.

                        Not only do the students from those aforementioned departments have issues with the last two years’ schedules and courses, but Engineering students are also afraid of next semester’s
                        schedule as all their classes are on Sunday, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. They expect they will have 2-3 exams on the same day.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        “I’m worried about having more than two exams on the same day since all engineering classes are on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. And these time slots will definitely affect students 
                        who must maintain CGPA above 2.3.” an engineering student says.

                    He also added, “I think the department of engineering has not offered enough classes that require senior standing. As a result, 
                    some students will not graduate on time because they’re missing a required class that was not offered.”
